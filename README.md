# pongGame

## Overview
My Pong game is a simplified version of the classic Pong game. This project is implemented in Java and uses the Processing library for graphics and animation.

## Features
- Two-player mode
- Basic collision detection

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AndrewJ1234/pongGame.git

## Dependencies
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Processing library
- JUnit for testing

## Technical requirements

This project depends upon the [Processing](http://processing.org/) library. The `.jar` files for this dependency are included within the `lib` directory.

However, Processing currently works only with Java 8. In order to have the Java Extensions for Visual Studio Code run the program with Java 8, instead of any newer version, you must do the following:

1. Download and install the [jdk8u242-b08 version of OpenJDK 8](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk8-binaries/releases/tag/jdk8u242-b08) - on MacOS, select the appropriate `.pkg` file; for Windows, select the appropriate `.msi` file (be sure to select the file with `jdk` in its name, not the one with `jre` in its name).
1. Note the file path to the directory where this new JDK was installed. We'll refer to this directory later as `THE_PATH_TO_JDK_8`.
   - On Mac, it is probably in `"/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/adoptopenjdk-8.jdk/Contents/Home"`. Note the inclusiong of `Contents/Home` at the end of the path - we'll need it with this addition in the settings file.
   - On Windows, it is probably in `C:\Program Files (x86)\AdoptOpenJDK\jdk-8.0.242.08-hotspot`, which would have to have its back slashes escaped to be `"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\AdoptOpenJDK\\jdk-8.0.242.08-hotspot"` in the settings file.
1. In Visual Studio Code, go to Settings (MacOS: `Code`->`Preferences`->`Settings`; Windows: `File`->`Preferences`->`Settings`), and enter "`java jdt ls java home` in the search field. You should see an option with a link to `Edit in settings.json` - click that link to open that file in the editor.
1. In the `settings.json`, edit the "`java.configuration.runtimes`" setting so that it includes the new JDK. If there is no such setting currently, add it. If the setting exists, and an existing JDK is listed there, you an keep both. For example (replace `THE_PATH_TO_JDK_8` with the correct path for your newly-installed JDK) :
   ```javascript
   "java.configuration.runtimes": [
       {
       "name": "JavaSE-1.8",
       "path": "THE_PATH_TO_JDK_8",
       "default": true
       },
       {
       "name": "JavaSE-15",
       "path": "THE_PATH_TO_AN_EXISTING_JDK",
       "default": false
       }
   ],
   ```
1. With this project open, go to Visual Studio Code's Command Palette (`View`->`Command Palette`) and search for "`Java: Configure Java Runtime`". Click on the matching option that appears.
1. In the `Configure Java Runtime` setting document, click the icon to edit the current runtime setting for this project and change it to the newly-installed JDK.
1. In the Command Palette again (`View`->`Command Palette`), search for "`Java: Clean Language Server Workspace`". Click the matching option that appears and confirm that you would like to reset the Java language server.

At this point, the project should run properly. Try it out.
